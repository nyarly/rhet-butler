Incrementals: slideset member -> multiple related slides.  Processing thing like:

Here are some bullets:

[1+: A bullet]
[2+: Another bullet]
[3+: More bulleting]

Or

def a_method([1: hl: args])
  [2: hl: interesting_line]
  another thing([1: hl: args])
end

Becomes nested div.step s in output - allows for css like:

div.step.inc-1 span.highlight.inc-1 {
  @include !code-highlighting
}

Incrementals differ from Steps because a) going back skips them and b) in an index view they're not listed

Slide reloading - I'm running EM already

Arrangement stereotype (automatic anonymous subclasses)

Localize assets - e.g. download everything in the Google Web Font stylesheet

SASS processing

Fork Impress - allow Android Chrome, support incrementals

Sockjs needs update - hopefully upstream current isn't as fragile/recognizes Android Chrome Websockets support
  Alternative: presenter mode doesn't need websockets, just AJAX.

Markdown slide renderer, make default

Slide group "default slide type" setting
