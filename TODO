Clean up the (obsolete) impress configuration stuff

Improve documentation

Improve parse errors

Missing assets: 404 (not 500)

Skel files for init - add *anything* to the right config dirs and have it
delivered to the new project

*** 1.0 milestone ***

Add transition editing help - "transition station breakpoints" + buttons/keys to manage

Live-reload support for authoring

Automate pushing static slides to gh-pages/S3/...?

let audience members download slides, code samples or other supplementary material

Items/cues: Handle am-at and animation delay for multiple cued item elements?
  Effectively needs a semaphore...

Raw HTML inclusion (pre rendered/hand built slides)

cue macros outside of RedCloth %(1) (using Ultisnips for this...)

Sub-presentation:
  e.g. iframe or svg
  Node in the JS prez tree that references an embedded HTML thing
  On parse, hooks in r-b.js into the embedded thing
  Focus "sticks" on the 'included' node until we leave it.

Presentation toolbar
  [prev] [slide index] [29:05] [next]
  Presenter slide index
    UX needs consideration
    Jump to slide
  Next/previous buttons (a/o/t taps on areas of screen)
  Timers (count up/down)
  Follower information (where they are etc)
  Voting?
  Twitter?

Live follow widgets
  voting
  pause connection = let me wander
  resume = jump to current presenters position

CSS emitters: impress-inspired layouts but with CSS instead of data-*

SSL support - self-signed certs, signed certs...

Better control messages
  Current is just "this is the step"
  Should be:
  { type: "step", data: "this is the step" }
  { type: "presenter-connection", data: "arrive"|"leave" }
  etc...
  { type: "increment", data: "this increment" }

Slide Queue needs to manage app state better - "is there a presenter?" "what's
current slide/increment?"

Presentation address macro (for live follow)
