!!! MUST set apps to check their path and 404 if not matched
  (Currently, missing assets returns the whole presentation html)

SSL support - self-signed certs, signed certs...

Better control messages
  Current is just "this is the step"
  Should be:
  { type: "step", data: "this is the step" }
  { type: "presenter-connection", data: "arrive"|"leave" }
  etc...
  { type: "increment", data: "this increment" }

Slide Queue needs to manage app state better - "is there a presenter?" "what's
current slide/increment?"

Incrementals: slideset member -> multiple related slides.  Processing thing like:

  Here are some bullets:

  [1+: A bullet]
  [2+: Another bullet]
  [3+: More bulleting]

  Or

  def a_method([1: hl: args])
    [2: hl: interesting_line]
    another thing([1: hl: args])
  end

  Becomes nested div.step s in output - allows for css like:

  div.step.inc-1 span.highlight.inc-1 {
    @include !code-highlighting
  }

  Incrementals differ from Steps because a) going back skips them and b) in an index view they're not listed

Admin style (and templating) for next slide, simple layout

Admin slide index
  UX needs consideration
  Jump to slide

Publish static to github pages - other destinations?

Debug Android Chrome "aw, snap" - impress? styles?
  Styles appear to take too long to render - argument for stripping down
  presenter styles

Slide reloading - I'm running EM already, so something like Watcher seems
obvious

Arrangements and layouts - actual use

Arrangement stereotype (automatic anonymous subclasses)

Localize assets - e.g. download everything in the Google Web Font stylesheet

Fork Impress - allow Android Chrome, support incrementals

Markdown slide renderer, make default

Slide group "default slide type" setting

Presentation address macro (for live follow)

Live follow widgets - voting, pause connection (let me wander, resume = jump to
current presenters position)
