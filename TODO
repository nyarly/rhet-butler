Incrementals: slideset member -> multiple related slides.  Processing thing like:

  Here are some bullets:

  [1+: A bullet]
  [2+: Another bullet]
  [3+: More bulleting]

  Or

  def a_method([1: hl: args])
    [2: hl: interesting_line]
    another thing([1: hl: args])
  end

  Becomes nested div.step s in output - allows for css like:

  div.step.inc-1 span.highlight.inc-1 {
    @include !code-highlighting
  }

  Incrementals differ from Steps because a) going back skips them and b) in an index view they're not listed

Admin style (and templating) for next slide, simple layout

Debug Android Chrome "aw, snap" - impress? styles?

Slide reloading - I'm running EM already, so something like Watcher seems
obvious

Arrangement stereotype (automatic anonymous subclasses)

Localize assets - e.g. download everything in the Google Web Font stylesheet

Fork Impress - allow Android Chrome, support incrementals

Markdown slide renderer, make default

Slide group "default slide type" setting
