Slide group "default slide type" setting

SSL support - self-signed certs, signed certs...

Better control messages
  Current is just "this is the step"
  Should be:
  { type: "step", data: "this is the step" }
  { type: "presenter-connection", data: "arrive"|"leave" }
  etc...
  { type: "increment", data: "this increment" }

Slide Queue needs to manage app state better - "is there a presenter?" "what's
current slide/increment?"

Better error for missing slide type

Incrementals: slideset member -> multiple related slides.  Processing thing like:

  Here are some bullets:

  [1+: A bullet]
  [2+: Another bullet]
  [3+: More bulleting]

  Or

  def a_method([1: hl: args])
    [2: hl: interesting_line]
    another thing([1: hl: args])
  end

  Becomes nested div.step s in output - allows for css like:

  div.step.inc-1 span.highlight.inc-1 {
    @include !code-highlighting
  }

  Incrementals differ from Steps because a) going back skips them and b) in an index view they're not listed

Admin style (and templating) for next slide, simple layout

Admin slide index
  UX needs consideration
  Jump to slide

Publish static to github pages - other destinations?

Slide reloading - I'm running EM already, so something like Watcher seems
obvious

Arrangements and layouts - actual use

Arrangement stereotype (automatic anonymous subclasses)

Localize assets - e.g. download everything in the Google Web Font stylesheet

Add Markdown slide renderer, make default
  Implication is plugable types - RedCloth and Kramdown? Why?

rhet-butler init <dir>
  mkdir, Load skeleton project from base_config, populate into <dir>

Presentation address macro (for live follow)

Live follow widgets - voting, pause connection (let me wander, resume = jump to
current presenters position)

Presentation widgets
  Timers (count up/down)
  Follower information (where they are etc)
  Voting?
  Twitter?
