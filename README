# Rhet Butler

A presentation app for developers and other tech people. Inspired by Showoff
and its "might could dos."

# Features

Slides are formatted as YAML.

Slides are styled with CSS (or CSS generating languages supported by Tilt)

Presentations driven by impress.js for all kinds of whiz-bang transition
effects.

Offline operation.  I can never get wifi in a crowded tech presentation.

Cascading configuration, so you can reuse slides, images, layouts, etc, without
having to keep copying everything everywhere. All your presentations should
start and end roughly the same way, so why repeat yourself?

# How do I use it?

Start by

  gem install rhet-butler

(If you're lucky and smart you might need to "sudo" that command)

This is one of the rare gems that's actually intended to be used as a command
line utility, so it really helps to install it system-wide.  (Or at least in
your user gem path.)

<A miracle occurs where you write a presentation in YAML.>

Run

  rhet-butler serve

You'll see come possible URLs for the presentation - pick one that seems
appropriate and plug it into your browser. There's a setup page with
instructions from there.

# Slide format

We take great advantage of the YAML format - it really is very nice, and you'll
do yourself a favor becoming more familiar. Rhet will do its best to output
useful error messages if you screw it up.

There's a few custom YAML tags that rhet-butler slides use:

  !slide
    content:
    notes:

  !group
    slides:

  #Used in configs
  !layout


# FAQ

Q. Why is it named after a character in Gone Wind the Wind?
A. It's not.  It's a helper for your speeches.  A rhetoric butler.  From there,
it's a *pun* on the name of a character in Gone With the Wind.

Q. Why a pun?
A. I should think that would be obvious.  Puns are awesome.
